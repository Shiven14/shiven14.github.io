            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a senior Computer Science major with a strong passion for software development. My experience includes working as a web development intern where I honed my skills in creating user-friendly websites and developed a robust Java program to automate email sending. Additionally, I contributed to the development of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for a surgical clinic, enhancing its functionality and improving the overall user experience. I am eager to leverage my skills and experiences to secure a position in the software development field, where I can contribute to innovative projects and continue to grow professionally.</p>
