                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I am currently a senior majoring in Computer Science, passionate about software development and eager to solve complex problems through technology. My academic journey has provided me with a solid foundation in computer science principles, algorithms, and data structures, which I have applied to various projects and internships.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my undergraduate studies, I engaged in several hands-on projects that allowed me to enhance my coding skills and develop a keen understanding of various programming languages and technologies. I completed my internship as a Web Development Intern, where I had the opportunity to create dynamic websites and applications. This experience honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, particularly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I contributed to the development of an Electronic Health Record (EHR) system for a surgical clinic, which involved improving system functionality and user experience. This project deepened my understanding of how technology can be leveraged to streamline complex processes and enhance operational efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
        My background also includes a solid understanding of version control systems, particularly Git, and a strong commitment to writing clean, maintainable code. I am continuously learning and staying updated with industry trends to ensure that my skills remain relevant and sharp.</p>

                <h2>Personal Touch</h2>
                <p> Outside of my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for exploring new technologies and creative problem-solving. My journey into the world of programming began with a fascination for video games and a desire to understand how they work behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to experiment with coding at a young age, and it quickly blossomed into a full-fledged interest in software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my technical pursuits, I enjoy hiking and spending time in nature. The problem-solving skills I’ve developed through programming have translated well into outdoor adventures, where planning, strategy, and adaptability are key. I find that exploring the great outdoors provides a refreshing balance to my screen time and fuels my creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m also an avid reader of science fiction and technology books. They inspire me to think about the future of technology and how emerging innovations can shape our world. This love for reading keeps me engaged with new ideas and motivates me to continually push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, my journey has been shaped by a blend of professional ambition and personal passions. These interests not only drive my career but also enrich my life, providing me with a well-rounded perspective that I bring to all my projects.</p>
