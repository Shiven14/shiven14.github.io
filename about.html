            <h1><strong>Biography</strong></h1>
            <p>
                From an early age, I was captivated by technology and its potential to solve real-world problems. 
                This passion led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at Temple University, 
                where I have honed my skills in software development, web technologies, and problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, automation, and cybersecurity, working with technologies 
                such as C, Swift, Java, Python, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL. My journey has included developing 
                real-time data visualization dashboards, building cybersecurity simulation platforms, and even contributing to 
                electronic health record (EHR) systems during my internship at Mainline Surgical Center.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a strong foundation in software engineering and a curiosity for emerging fields like AI and cybersecurity, 
                I am excited about the opportunities ahead. I aim to work on projects that push boundaries, create meaningful impact, 
                and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech space.
